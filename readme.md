# Jack in the Box

## Design

Please put your sketches or designs for the Jack in the Box.

Since I used the Brooklyn Brewery cartboard that I found in the recycle trash in the basement, I thought it would best fit to make a bottle instead of a jack. I lasered a Brooklyn Lager bottle and cut it out.

Here's a picture of my cut out "Jack" before I cut it out:

This is the final "jack" after I cut it out:

## Laser Cutting

**a. Include a photo of your box here.**

I also took a video of the laser cutter: [Laser Video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AOlSU0veGQhgrQ0cH3DYCAunRFqZq8Ek)

**b. Include `.stl` files.**

This is the file I used to cut the box. Instead of an .stl file, it is an Adobe Illustrator file as I used that program to cut the box.

## 3D Printing

**a. Include a photo of your printed part here.**


Here's a picture of the printed part integrated into my box:

**b. Include `.stl` or `.svg` files if you made modifications.**

I did not make any modifications, so I did not upload the files.

## Electronics

**a. Upload code & a photo of your electronic circuit here.**

## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.
2. At least one photo of your Jack in the Box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).
3. A video of your Jack in the Box in action.
